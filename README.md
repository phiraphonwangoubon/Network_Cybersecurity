# This repository was created to document my hands-on labs and learning journey in Cybersecurity. The goal is to develop practical skills in both Blue Team operations and Penetration Testing through real-world exercises. This project serves not only as a collection of lab files, but also as a structured learning journal that reflects my progress from fundamental cybersecurity concepts to more advanced topics. 

--- ## 🎯 Objectives 

    - Build a strong foundation in Network Security and System Security

    - Gain hands-on experience with Firewalls, VPNs, Logging, and SIEM tools (Splunk)

    - Practice security log analysis and incident detection from a Blue Team perspective

    - Develop skills in Web Application Hacking and Penetration Testing methodologies

    - Maintain this repository as both a professional portfolio and a personal learning journal for future reference
