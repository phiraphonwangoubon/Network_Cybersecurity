##Cybersecurity##

Performed web application security testing by identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in controlled lab environments.

Conducted SQL Injection attacks to bypass authentication, extract database information, and analyze improper input validation mechanisms.

Tested XSS vulnerabilities to understand client-side attacks, including reflected and stored XSS, and evaluated potential impacts on user sessions and data security.

Explored Steganography techniques by detecting, extracting, and analyzing hidden data embedded within image and media files.

Used John the Ripper to perform password cracking through dictionary attacks and brute-force methods for security assessment purposes.

Analyzed password hashing mechanisms and evaluated password strength and common weaknesses in authentication systems.

Practiced ethical hacking methodologies, following a structured approach including reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis.

Gained experience working in capture-the-flag (CTF)-style labs, focusing on problem-solving, vulnerability analysis, and secure system assessment.
